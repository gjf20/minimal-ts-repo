# This repo is meant to be cloned / forked

This repo is the minimal set of development tools that I like to use to develop typescript.

It is a base example of an ejected CRA application.  This means it uses webpack as the bundler.

### Notable features:
- eslint / prettier
- typescript
- React
- gitignore
- dockerignore
- base public resources custom to me


### Configuration
- Node: v18.19.0
