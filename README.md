This repo is the minimal set of development tools that I like to use to develop typescript.
It is a base example of an ejected CRA application.  This means it uses webpack as the bundler.
I've edited the start and build scripts to better accomodate my specific needs to give me a bundle profiler.

### Notable features:
- eslint / prettier
- typescript
- React
- ignore files for
    - docker 
    - eslint
    - prettier
    - git
- base public resources custom to me
- Visual Studio settings and tasks


### Configuration
- Node: v18.19.0
